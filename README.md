# Workshop: Development and Coding Standards

## Installation and execution the model code

To manage python requirements we're using [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv#installation). On Fedora you should be
good with running `sudo dnf install pipenv`.

TODO: check if this works and if the interns have rhel CSB?!

Now install all requirements with `pipenv install` and enter a shell with the correct python settings: `pipenv shell`
If some dependencies are missing when you run your code, you might be in another shell without the correct settings.
Again, run `pipenv shell` in this directory or always execute your code with `pipenv run python model.py`

Then you can run the code via `python model.py`
